My idea is:

* If there are data already loaded, and the endpoint fails when trying to update that data, just do nothing. It'll try again automatically in 2 minutes.","09/Jul/18 9:48 am; eerkmen; @Noel Broda sorry didn't see your comment until too late.

 ","03/Aug/18 6:09 am; eerkmen; @Rich Wagner @Mark Van Der Hyde I think they have finally solved the issue by **NOT** sending us a `profileImageUrl` at all for instagram posts anymore.

So, the only solution right now would be to create an Instagram app and use it's credentials to query Instagram for the profile image URLs. This will be time consuming both on our part as development time and as server time as we will have to query Instagram API for every profile we got.","03/Aug/18 8:36 am; mvanderhyde; @Emre Erkmen thanks. I think instagram is retiring their API anyway so it would be a wash. @Alan Humphrey @Rich Wagner and I can chat with the client on that.","03/Aug/18 11:09 am; rwagner; @Mark Van Der Hyde @Alan Humphrey Seems like this issue needs to be brought up with Marriott to then deal with with Sprinklr.

","03/Aug/18 12:33 pm; ahumphrey; @Rich Wagner we can bring up with Aynat on our status call this afternoon. Spoke about this with @Mark Van Der Hyde earlier and sounds like the only solution we have is to not show the avatar image for IG posts? Or are you saying that Sprinklr should be able to provide this and they've just removed from what they're sending us rather than trying to solve the issue on their end (hence escalation needed)?","03/Aug/18 12:39 pm; rwagner; Yeah, that was one of the data points that we looked for during evaluation period since we were planning to display profile images for Instagram posts. And it showed up in the results, hence we assumed that it would be something available and useable. 

One note however on whether Sprinklr did or did not change that. I am not sure that they actually removed that data point in response to our request. I just tried a query and was able to get that: 

```
   'profileImgUrl': 'https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-19/11324485_1613298918919753_130699154_a.jpg',
``` 
However, this still gives us an error like before. 

My guess is that Emre got back several posts that do not have those values (which i have seen before as well). 

To sum up, we are certain that we are not getting those data points for Sprinklr - they are either blank or invalid. We are uncertain whether or not sprinklr changed anything or whether it is just like it was.  
","03/Aug/18 3:43 pm; ahumphrey; @Rich Wagner brought this issue up with the client on status and they are in agreement, the profile image and main image is something we need and is expected of Sprinklr.

Seems like the library that we are using doesn't allow us to create charts responsive in width and height.
We can set the responsive behavior only in width or height.
Currently, we use the 100% of width, so the height should be fixed.
Do to height is fixed, we can not set a dynamic value to make it responsive.

For the records: more info about this library in http://recharts.org/en-US/api/ResponsiveContainer","27/Aug/18 10:07 pm; brodanoel; Something that we can do here is tracking the browser size change event and change the fixed height value dynamically.
That's going to take a lot of time due to we'll have a create some kind of hardcoded rule like: 'For resolution 1400px, set 200px, for resolution 1450px, set 205px, for resolution 1500px, set 210px... etc', and we should re-draw the Chart every time the resolution change.

"Metrics Available from Sprinklr API (Owned & Earned Screens)",,ahumphrey,Development,Highest,"@Rich Wagner @Emre Erkmen as we shift our attentions back to the remaining screens I connected with @michaeledowd regarding a couple of the data points in earned and owned screens. Can you connect with your Sprinklr tech contacts to find out the following:
1. Do they have an `Engagement Rate` metric we could use for the earned & owned screen score (with fire icon - see below). This score is meant to signify how well followers engage with their posts/content. Ideally this would include historical posts and not just the individual post we are displaying.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35970545/44671836-9616ef80-a9f4-11e8-9adc-1415c2fff72a.png)

2.  If they don't have `Engagement Rate` as a metric, do they have any recommendations for a comparable metric with can use for owned/earned? @michaeledowd found they have an `Influencer Score` that looks like it might provide another option for the Earned dashboard. If so, could we get details on how they calculate this?

3. Also, can you confirm whether we can pull metrics for the entire history of a Twitter user. For example: Total number of tweets a user has made; Total number of likes received for all posts; Total number of retweets they've received for all posts; Total Reach of all their posts and Average Tweets per day?

> Sprinklr applies an Influencer Score to universal profiles that are pulled into Sprinklr Listening. Sprinklr's Influencer score ranges from 1 to 100, from lowest to highest level of influence, and is calculated through indicators like followers and status count, and is adjusted through machine learning. Influencer Score can be applied as a filter in Listening Dashboards, in Listening widgets, and in Listening Themes. Additionally, you can configure Listening widgets using specific dimensions to capture data on Influencer Score.

> Insight into the influence of users allows you to identify the most influential users as you analyze data. You may want to use the Influencer Score to help measure the success of campaigns based on the number of influential profiles you reached, to find the best brand advocates, or to ensure that your Customer Care team is prioritizing top influencers.

I'm seeing the influencer score > 0 for 25847 out of 35163 total profiles. (73%) So I guess we can use that with some confidence.

As discussed, the next step is for you to review metrics and data points in the designs and make sure there aren't any red flags based on what we can get from Sprinklr/Twitter direct APIs. Specifically:

**Owned Dashboard**
- [ ] Are we able to pull engagement metrics, post content etc. needed for IG posts from Marriott's owned channels? This is something we will need to confirm with Sprinklr's tech team.
- [ ] If we have to go the Twitter only route, what/if any are the limitations we should be aware of using the direct Twitter API (you mentioned not being able to get 'reach' metric as an example on the call)?
- [ ] Confirm there aren't any issues getting the overall social metrics outlined in designs via Sprinklr API?
- [ ] Assumptions for the dashboard settings is the user will be able to filter the feed in the dashboard by (a) Owned brand channels (i.e. @marriottrewards or @WHotels etc.), (b) Social networks (Twitter or Instagram), (c) Keyword, (d) date range (e) Language (if possible). Advise if you see any issues with any of these requirements? **NOTE**: @Brian Weaver will work on finalizing the comps for these.
- [ ] Current assumption was we only needed 2 calls every 30 seconds for this dashboard (if we're going through Sprinklr). We will need this validated or amended if we end up going this route.

Here are some notes and questions: (They are not necesseraliy aligned with the order above)

1. It looks like we can get Instagram data from Sprinklr again. But I can not vouch for the data integrity. We'll have to do a prototype implementation to be sure.

2. For filtering, they can be done, but full text search (hashtag search) can be slow in some cases.

3. Will we monitor just the owned posts, or replies as well?

4. In an owned context, what would the engagement rate mean? (The flaming number)

5. It looks like we're going to monitor about 30 accounts per social channel. I think 1 query per 30 seconds will be enough to get the latest data, if we're to monitor just Marriotts posts and not the replies.

6. It looks like we're going with Sprinklr to get all the data (still going to check with Rich on this), so we can do about a 10 query run one time to get the older data for the owned feed.

7. In that case we need to figure out a new topic that will give us exactly this result through queries. Meaning they should either themselves create or help us create the topic that has the necessary query that filters everything other than Marriott accounts.

8. Is the YouTube card still relevant?","04/Sep/18 9:33 am; ahumphrey; Thanks @Emre Erkmen. My responses to your questions below:
1. Understood

4. @michaeledowd to provide this per ticket #212 
5. I'm estimating the number of channels to be closer to 80, but I will confirm this with client (see link below to the spreadsheets provided to us. I've highlighted the Twitter and IG accounts)

2. I think they should be able to get the results in a second or so. But this will get worse and worse as we accumulate hundreds of thousands of posts. If they need a filter as you type of thing, that's most probably out of question unless we create a separate search server via Lucene or some other tech, which should take about 1-2 weeks.

Advise if you see any issues with this?` -> we're not getting a language from the Sprinklr posts unfortunately. For other filtering answers see #209

","11/Sep/18 9:09 am; ; Engagement Rate for any platform is the sum of all engagement types (comments, likes, shares, retweets...) divided by the number of followers. Because we cannot get historical data for individual users to the best of my knowledge, all of this data is relative to the single post that we captured (except followers, which is global to the user).

Note that:
1) this calculation isn't TECHNICALLY correct, because people can engage, but not follow, but it would be far too laborious and likely impossible to match up engagements to individual followers.
2) The number will almost never be anywhere close to 86%, so don't worry if you're seeing sub-1% numbers. That said, based on the data that comes in, we should consider changing the UI to support decimals.

As for date ranges, I don't think that All Time is necessary.

We just discussed the Owned and Earned 'settings', and how to implement them. They will be specific to each dashboard, so Owned settings will be controlled from the Owned dashboard, and Earned settings will be controlled from the Earned dashboard. Most likely we will have a filter icon in the header, or something similar. Clicking on that filter icon will open a modal. So we will be maintaining the same paradigm as the Create Event modal.

"No data displaying for certain stories in NewsWhip widget on Current Events",ahumphrey,ahumphrey,Development,Highest,"@Emre Erkmen can you look into why some of the NewsWhip stories are displaying `0 predicted interactions 49 years ago`.

1. BONVOY + CO-BRAND CARD MENTIONS
2. OBOP LOYALTY MENTIONS

","20/Feb/19 2:57 am; eerkmen; @Alan Humphrey that is because newswhip is passing us stories that have 0 predicted interactions which would have happened in 1969 (timestamp 0). The reason is probably that Newswhip don't have any recent metrics or couldn't yet make a prediction about them. But they are published nonetheless and the service is getting us the most recent stories per our query.

If you want those cases to be handled in a specific way (i.e. hide the predictions altogether if timestamp is 0, or display a message instead of the graph) please let me know. If we can handle this inside the update package rather than now, even better. :) (But can definitely get on that now, if needed. Should be pretty easy.)","20/Feb/19 9:11 am; ahumphrey; @Emre Erkmen thanks for the feedback. Is there a reason why it's displaying 1969 if there is no predicted interactions data? Seem a little odd to have that specific year showing. Also, for the NewsWhip widget we are only showing last 24 hours right?

Lastly, do you think you could send me a screenshot of what we're seeing on the backend for those stories they called out... showing 0 predicted interactions. That'll be helpful as they will most likely loop NewsWhip into the conversation. Thanks","20/Feb/19 9:23 am; eerkmen; Oh it's just because it corresponds to the UNIX timestamp of 0 (I said 1969, but it is actually 01-01-1970), which is what Newswhip is sending us. Like I said, we can just handle that ourselves.
